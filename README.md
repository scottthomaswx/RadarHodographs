# RadarHodographs
Plot radar based hodographs colored by levels for mesoanalysis using Amazon Web Services level 2 radar data archive. Includes calculation of multiple forms of storm motion and the ability to plot storm relative hodographs. Includes calculation of Bulk Shear, Storm Relative Helicity, Storm Relative Wind, Streamwise Vortiicity and Percentage of Vorticity That's Streamwise. These are calculated for the 0-500m, 0-1km,0-3km, 0-6km, and 0-8km levels. Plots of streamwise vorticity percentage and storm relarive wind are shown for the 0-3km levels.
