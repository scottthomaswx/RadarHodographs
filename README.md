# RadarHodographs
Plot radar based hodographs colored by levels for mesoanalysis Includes calculation of multiple forms of storm motion and the ability to plot storm relative hodographs. Includes calculation of key kinematic parameters such as Bulk Shear, Storm Relative Wind, SRH, Streamwise Vorticity Percentage and Streamwse Vorticity Magnitude. Options include Level 2 (Raw) Wind Profiles and Level 3 (VAD) Wind Profiles.

Note... In order to pull in surface wind data, a SynopticData API Key is required. NOAA Employees can obtain a key by registering with their NOAA account. Researchers and educational institutions can obtain one free through Synoptic Data's website. Public API Keys are not available. If you do not have a key, you are welcome to manually provide your surface observation. https://synopticdata.com/weatherapi/
